# 21st-Century-Chip
A modern computational architecture for the 21st century.

The major idea is to learn to think about circuitry in language which can translate both into CA and into transistors space, and be optimized for both. Creating components which have "cost value" for each implementation - cost is physical cost of transistor count, and  speed of execution mesured in cicles. The design patterns will come from both FPGAs and CA. 

The architecture will use hive mind to compete over usability of shared components by the community, and thus the community will create the best and most effitient circuitry. We will provide a platform to share, contribute and make money out of making good functions and code, and documentation that will be shared in some wiki space, and people will know to search, find, use, and develop the next level of functions and classes. The hardware will immediatelly implement the most important and usable software, and the system is working like science - the more people need it the 

We start from address tree as initial point to provide some sort of hierarchy and generality in the design. Eventually the chip itself will be modified by the community as well. See project hives.
